--- Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports ---

--- Part one ---
A report only counts as safe if both of the following are true:

    - The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
    - Any two adjacent levels differ by at least one and at most three.

You need to count how many safe reports there are.

--- Part Two ---
The Problem Dampener:
    - If by removing one level, the report is then safe, then the report is considered safe.

You need to count how many safe reports there are, taking into account the problem dampener.
